## About the Project

This is a project created as part of the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) curriculum, week 9. Our project this week is to build a frontend for one of the APIs from REST API week. It should be a single-page app rendered with client-side JavaScript.

* [The API](https://github.com/fac20/week-7-BFOP) we are using for this project is one we created a previous week.
